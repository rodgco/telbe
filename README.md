# Telbe

A complete ruby client that implements [Telegram's Bot API](https://core.telegram.org/bots).

Ruby is such a beautiful and productive language.

SimplifyApi is being used to automagicaly objectify JSON and JSONify objects, it also implements a "safe" environment to accomodate future API specifications without too much burden.

Currently under heavy development (or maybe not!).

Please [collaborate](https://github.com/rodgco/telbe/issues/new) with your questions, ideas or problems!

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile (currently under development):
