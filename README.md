# Telbe

A complete ruby client that implements [Telegram's Bot API](https://core.telegram.org/bots).

Ruby is such a beautiful and productive language.

[Virtus](https://github.com/solnic/virtus) is heavilly used, mainly because it's easy to instantiate objects from hashes, even complex objects. Virtus is deprecated, at a future release we'll evaulate differente approaches to address the problem.

Currently under heavy development.

Please [collaborate](https://github.com/rodgco/telbe/issues/new) with your questions, ideas or problems!

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile (currently under development):

```ruby
gem 'telbe'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle
